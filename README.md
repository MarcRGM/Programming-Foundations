# Programming Foundations

This repository is dedicated to strengthening my foundations in programming. It contains hands-on practice, mini-projects, notes, and examples across multiple languages and technologies.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

To revisit and reinforce core programming concepts through real code â€” including syntax, logic, data structures, and APIs â€” while also getting better at using Git and GitHub.
